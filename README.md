## 📱 Quick Vision

<div align="center">

### 🚀 Background Wake-up + Siri Voice Trigger!

**No need to unlock your phone - just say a word and let AI identify everything in front of you**

Due to Meta DAT SDK limitations, the app cannot directly access the glasses camera in the background. We innovatively combined **Siri Shortcuts + App Intent + TTS** to achieve this feature:

- 📱 **Siri Voice Wake-up**: Just say "Hey Siri, TurboMeta Quick Vision"
- ⌚ **Action Button Trigger** (iPhone 15 Pro+): One-tap Quick Vision
- 🔊 **Voice Result Announcement**: High-quality text-to-speech result announcement
- 🎯 **Fully Automated**: Start stream → Capture → Stop stream → AI Recognition → TTS Announcement
